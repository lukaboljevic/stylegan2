# Deep learning project - StyleGAN2-ADA

This is the source code for a project at course Deep Learning, regarding the re-implementation and testing of [StyleGAN2-ADA paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06676.pdf), "Training Generative Adversarial Networks with Limited Data".

The goal is to first implement, train and test StyleGAN2, and then move on to the ADA part.

When running the scripts, make sure the path to the root directory is added to `PYTHONPATH`.
